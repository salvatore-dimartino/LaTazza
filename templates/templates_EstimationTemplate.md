# Data from your LaTazza project

###

|         Total person days worked by your  team, considering period March 5 to April 26 (1 person day == 8 person hours)     |   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|Total Java LoC delivered on April 26 (only code, no Junit code) | 869 |
| Total number of Java classes delivered on April 26 (only code, no Junit code)| 9 |
| Productivity P = LOC/Total person days | 869/(74 hours=9 person days)=96.5 |
|Average size of Java class A = | 96.5 |
