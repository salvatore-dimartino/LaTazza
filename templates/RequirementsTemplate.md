# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>

## Use Cases
\<describe here each use case in the UCD>

### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |  
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished> |
|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other executions, ex in case of errors> |

### Use case 2, UC2

### Use case \<n>


# Relevant scenarios
State at which UC the scenario refers to
\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>
\<a scenario is more formal description of a story>
\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

## Scenario 1
